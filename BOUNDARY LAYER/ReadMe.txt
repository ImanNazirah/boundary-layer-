The task that has been given is to study on researcher's paper and get the same output as the journal.
The derivation of formula is shown in power point and also in pdf files as well. 
In order to solve the problem we need to use software tools such as Matlab. 
Matlab bvp4c is an easier method for solving the non linear differential equation in Matlab instead of writing the long code of  Runge Kutta method. 
The coding that has been written can refer to MHD.m file.
